This is a modified version of Constantin's excellent work at that can be found at https://github.com/jaecktec/aws-cdk-appmesh-example/tree/final, which was the only functioning example of appmesh with CDK that I could find.

I have made three main changes:

- Upgraded it to CDK 2
- Refactored the import statements to make dependencies explicit in the code, for readability
- Updated the Envoy Docker image

As with upstream, this code is licensed under MIT.
